# DunzoAssignment

Write the working code to create a working coffee machine. Here are the desired features
1. It will be serving some beverages.
2. Each beverage will be made using some ingredients.
3. Assume time to prepare a beverage is the same for all cases.
4. The quantity of ingredients used for each beverage can vary. Also, the same ingredient (ex:
water) can be used for multiple beverages.
5. There would be N ( N is an integer ) outlet from which beverages can be served.
7. Maximum N beverages can be served in parallel.
8. Any beverage can be served only if all the ingredients are available in terms of quantity.
9. There would be an indicator that would show which all ingredients are running low. We need
some methods to refill them.
10.Please provide functional integration test cases for maximum coverage.


Example:
Consider Chai Point machine which serves these drinks:
1. ginger tea
2. elaichi tea
3. coffee
4. hot milk
5. hot water
the machine has N outlets for serving these drinks
Here is the composition for each drink:
1. ginger tea:
- hot water 50 ml
- hot milk 10 ml
- tea leaves syrup 10 ml
- ginger syrup 5 ml
- sugar syrup 10 ml
2. elaichi tea:
- hot water 50 ml
- hot milk 10 ml
- tea leaves syrup 10 ml
- elaichi syrup 5 ml
- sugar syrup 10 ml
3. coffee:
- hot water 50 ml
- hot milk 10 ml
- coffee syrup 10 ml
- sugar syrup 10 ml
4. hot milk:
- milk 50 ml
5. hot water
- water 50 ml
Note: Since there are N outlets, N people can take beverages at the same time.
